# ADM Emulator

This project is based on [tango-adb/old-demo](https://github.com/tango-adb/old-demo) which gives API Reference for using [tango](https://github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb). It uses a subset of features provided by the library to manage and connect to emulators using WebSockets.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dev-rvk/adm-emulator
cd adm-emulator
```

2. Install dependancies

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. Run in developement environment

```sh
pnpm recursive run build
pnpm recursive run dev                                           
```

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm recursive run build
```

## Generate static build that can be hosted on GitHub Pages

This project was built using `Next.js`
However, since it doesn't have any server-side code, the most simple deployment method is to use the [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) feature of Next.js. It generates pre-rendered, fully static HTML files, that can be deployed to any static website hosting services (e.g. GitHub Pages).

To export static deployable HTML files, after running `rush build` command, run:

```sh
cd packages/adm-emulator
npx next export
```

This will create an `out` folder containing exported HTML files and all required resource files.
