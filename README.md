# ADM Emulator

This is the now deprecated demo project for `@yume-chan/adb` package. It won't be updated, but it still mostly reflects the current API.

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm recursive run build
```

## Generate static build that can be hosted on GitHub Pages

The demo is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a full-stack React framework, which usually requires a Node.js environment to run.

However, since the demo doesn't have any server-side code, the most simple deployment method is to use the [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) feature of Next.js. It generates pre-rendered, fully static HTML files, that can be deployed to any static website hosting services (e.g. GitHub Pages).

To export static deployable HTML files, after running `rush build` command, run:

```sh
cd packages/demo
npx next export
```

This will create an `out` folder containing exported HTML files and all required resource files.
